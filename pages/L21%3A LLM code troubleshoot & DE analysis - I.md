		- Principal Component Analysis (#PCA ) is a statistical tool used for dimensionality reduction, "projecting" the data into fewer dimensions that retain most of the variance within the data.
		- In our example of RNA-seq data (30,560 genes Ã— 30 samples), PCA can reduce the 30,560 dimensions/features to a smaller set of variables (2 #[[principal components]], i.e., #eigenvectors ) that can explain most of the #variance (e.g., PC1 explains 81% of the variance, indicated by the corresponding #eigenvalues; PC2 is orthogonal to PC1 and captures the next greatest variance, 10%).

		- Note that DESeq's #rlog and #vst normalization (section II of our example code, which generates normalized counts and corresponding exploratory graphs such as clustering and PCA), and differential expression (#DE ) analysis  (section III of our example code, which identifies a list of DE genes with corresponding statistics), are both started with the #[[raw counts]] embedded in #DESeqDataSet 's count table #countData (section I of our example code).

			- Task 1a of #DE analysis, count normalization
				- NOTE: in DESeq2, this step of the #DESeq() function does not perform exactly the rlog or vst normalization procedure but normalizes #[[raw counts]] using #[[size factors]], and the results are used in constructing the statistical model in task 1c.
