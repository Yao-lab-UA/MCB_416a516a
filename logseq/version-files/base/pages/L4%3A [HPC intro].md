	- **S1-S5**: CoS public lecture series; #Github outline/notes; #UQ 2 (explanation), #UQ 3
- # Section 3: HPC Introduction
	- **S6**: RNA-seq workflow: we now enter the sequencing data analysis part
	- **S7**: Public sequencing data repository
		- International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), an international partnership between three organizations: the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI/NIH) in the United States, which hosts GenBank; the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) through the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), which hosts the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA); and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).
		- The Sequence Read Archive (#SRA) is is part of this collaboration and serves as the main repository for high-throughput sequencing data.
		- The databases act as mirrors, meaning they host the same data and provide different interfaces and routes for researchers to browse and download the data.
		- Other resources and tools are present and provide further integration and annotations for sequencing data, such as MetaSRA and Recount.
	- **S8**: Intro to High Performance Computing (#HPC )
		- #UNIX is the operating system that provides the overall system-level environment.
		- #Bash is a #shell used within the UNIX environment. It interprets commands from users and scripts, and communicates with the UNIX kernel to execute these commands.
		- #SLURM is a job scheduler used in HPC. It manages workloads and provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring submitted jobs.
	- **S9**: UA HPC system: [https://uarizona.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UAHPC/overview](https://uarizona.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UAHPC/overview)
