	- S8: Human genome sequencing (then and now)
	- S9: #Slido - How long does it take to sequence one human genome now?
	- S10: NGS Big Data â†’ #Bioinformatics
		- Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates biology, statistics, and computer science to analyze and interpret biological data
	- S11: #[[Functional genomics]]
		- Functional genomics is the study of the genome-wide, dynamic expression of gene products, including their interactions with environmental factors such as metabolites, in specific contexts that lead to distinct phenotypes, such as those observed at specific developmental stages or disease states.
		- Various functional genomics approaches:
			- DNA level (genomics and epigenomics)
			- RNA level (transcriptomics)
			- Protein level (proteomics)
			- Metabolite level (metabolomics)
